# Find dynamic libraries for an executable and copy them into the executable's
# directory. Unfortunately, this does not work for the dynamic linker itself.
#
#
# There are three solutions, each with different drawbacks:
#
# * A wrapper executable calls the correct dynamic linker explicitly to load
#   the executable.  Drawback: the process looks a bit weird in 'ps', but
#   otherwise all is well; setuid needs some extra steps.
#
# * You can use the original binary as-is, in the hope that the target system's
#   dynamic linker is compatible. This fails for example on old target OSes.
#
# * You can patch the dynamic linker path in the original binary into a relative
#   path. The drawback is that the binary must be started with its own directory
#   as the working directory, it cannot sensibly be put into $PATH.
#
# This script implements the third solution, despite its noticeable drawback.
# Unfortunately, the other two variants have proven to be unreliable in
# various corner cases.
